- Comprehensive error handling system

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with Hooks for state management
- **Styling**: CSS with custom styling and responsive design principles
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js for weather data graphs and visualizations
- **PDF Generation**: jsPDF and jspdf-autotable for creating downloadable reports
- **API Integration**: Axios for HTTP requests to the Tomorrow.io weather API
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

### 2.2 Component Structure

The application follows a modular component-based architecture:

```

│   └── pdfReportService.js      # PDF generation functionality
└── App.jsx                      # Main application component
```

### 2.3 Data Flow

The application follows a unidirectional data flow pattern:

1. User interactions trigger API requests through the weather service
2. The service processes the request, applies throttling if needed, and makes the API call
3. Response data is validated and transformed into the application's data model
4. Component state is updated with the new data, triggering re-renders
5. Error handling intercepts any issues and displays appropriate feedback

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 Weather Data Retrieval

The application fetches three primary types of weather data:

- **Current Weather**: Real-time conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather status
- **Forecast Data**: Hourly predictions for the next 24 hours and daily forecasts for upcoming days
- **Historical Data**: Weather conditions from the past 7 days for trend analysis

All data is retrieved from the Tomorrow.io API, which provides comprehensive meteorological information with high accuracy.

### 3.2 PDF Report Generation

The application offers multiple report types that users can generate and download:

- **Comprehensive Report**: Combines current, forecast, and historical data in a single document
- **Current Weather Report**: Focuses on present conditions with detailed metrics
- **Forecast Report**: Provides hourly and daily predictions in tabular format
- **Historical Report**: Shows weather trends from the past week
- **Custom Report**: Allows users to select specific sections to include

Reports are generated using jsPDF and jspdf-autotable, creating professional-looking documents with consistent formatting.

### 3.3 API Request Management

To ensure optimal performance and prevent API rate limiting issues, the application implements:

- **Request Throttling**: Enforces a minimum 2-second interval between API requests
- **API Usage Monitoring**: Tracks the number and types of requests made
- **API Key Validation**: Verifies API key validity before making requests

These measures help manage the application's dependency on external services and provide transparency about API usage.

### 3.4 Error Handling System

The application features a comprehensive error handling system that:

- Categorizes errors into specific types (API key issues, rate limiting, network problems, etc.)
- Provides user-friendly error messages with actionable suggestions
- Offers retry functionality for failed operations
- Maintains consistent error reporting across all components

This approach improves user experience by clearly communicating issues and potential solutions.

### 3.5 User Interface

The UI design emphasizes clarity, usability, and visual appeal:

- **Frosted Glass Effect**: Semi-transparent containers with blur for a modern look
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes and devices
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Sidebar menu for easy access to different sections
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading indicators, success messages, and error displays
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and graphs for weather trends and comparisons

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Weather Service Implementation

The `simpleWeatherService.js` module serves as the application's interface to the Tomorrow.io API:

```javascript
// Key components of the weather service
const simpleWeatherService = {
  // API methods
  getCurrentWeatherByCity: async (city) => { /* ... */ },
  getForecastByCity: async (city) => { /* ... */ },
  getHistoricalWeatherByCity: async (city, days = 7) => { /* ... */ },
  
  // Helper methods
  getWeatherStatus: (code) => { /* ... */ },
  getWeatherCode: (status) => { /* ... */ },
  
  // API management
  getApiRequestCount: () => { /* ... */ },
  resetApiRequestCount: () => { /* ... */ },
  getThrottleSettings: () => { /* ... */ },
  getApiStatus: () => { /* ... */ },
  validateApiKey: async () => { /* ... */ }
};
```

The service implements several key features:

- **Request Throttling**: Using async/await with setTimeout to space out API calls
- **Error Parsing**: Converting API errors into application-specific error types
- **Data Transformation**: Processing raw API responses into more usable formats
- **Request Counting**: Tracking API usage statistics for monitoring

### 4.2 PDF Report Generation

The `pdfReportService.js` module handles the creation of downloadable PDF reports:

```javascript
// PDF generation methods
const pdfReportService = {
  generateWeatherReportPDF: (currentWeather, forecast, history, city) => { /* ... */ },
  generateCurrentWeatherPDF: (currentWeather, city) => { /* ... */ },
  generateForecastPDF: (forecast, city) => { /* ... */ },
  generateHistoricalPDF: (history, city) => { /* ... */ },
  generateCustomReportPDF: (data, city, sections) => { /* ... */ }
};
```

The service uses jsPDF and jspdf-autotable to create structured documents with:

- Proper headers, footers, and page numbering
- Tabular data presentation for forecasts and historical information
- Consistent styling and formatting across different report types
- Dynamic content based on available data and user selections

### 4.3 Error Handling Implementation

The error handling system consists of several components:

1. **Custom Error Types**: Defined in the weather service to categorize different error scenarios
2. **Error Parsing**: Logic to convert API responses into specific error types
3. **ErrorDisplay Component**: Reusable UI element for presenting errors to users
4. **Component Integration**: Error state management in each feature component

This layered approach ensures consistent error handling throughout the application.

### 4.4 API Usage Monitoring

The `ApiUsageStats` component provides a floating panel that displays:

- Total number of API requests made
- Breakdown by request type (current, forecast, historical)
- Time since last reset
- Controls for refreshing stats or resetting counters

This feature helps developers and users monitor API consumption and manage rate limits.

## 5. Challenges and Solutions

### 5.1 API Rate Limiting

**Challenge**: The Tomorrow.io API has a rate limit of 3 requests per second, causing errors when multiple requests were made in quick succession.

**Solution**: Implemented a request throttling mechanism that enforces a minimum 2-second delay between API calls, preventing rate limit errors while maintaining application functionality.

### 5.2 Error Handling Complexity

**Challenge**: Different API errors required different user feedback and recovery strategies.

**Solution**: Developed a comprehensive error classification system with custom error types and a reusable error display component that provides context-specific guidance.

### 5.3 PDF Generation Performance

**Challenge**: Generating complex PDFs with large datasets could potentially impact application performance.

**Solution**: Optimized the PDF generation process by selectively including data based on report type and implementing efficient table generation with jspdf-autotable.

### 5.4 API Key Management

**Challenge**: Ensuring API keys are valid and properly secured.

**Solution**: Stored API keys in environment variables, implemented key validation before making requests, and provided clear feedback when key issues arise.

## 6. Future Scope
