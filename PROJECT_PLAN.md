- [x] Install necessary dependencies (Axios)
- [x] Create API service for Tomorrow.io
- [x] Set up environment variables for API keys
- [ ] Obtain Tomorrow.io API key
- [ ] Test API integration

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- [x] Implement geolocation for automatic location detection
- [ ] Build current weather display component
- [ ] Create hourly forecast component
- [ ] Develop daily/weekly forecast component
- [ ] Add location search functionality

### Phase 3: UI Development
- [ ] Design and implement responsive layout
- [ ] Create weather condition icons/visuals
- [ ] Add animations and transitions

## Progress Log

### March 21, 2025
- Project initialized with React 19 and Vite
- Project plan created
- Basic project structure set up
- Installed Axios for API requests
- Created weatherService.js for Tomorrow.io API integration
- Implemented geolocation utility functions
- Set up environment variables for API keys
- Created WeatherTest component for testing API integration
